# Mathematica Advent of Code
# 2020

This repository stores my [Advent Of Code](http://adventofcode.com/2020/) solutions for 2020, written in Mathematica.  Some of these solutions are simple one-liners, and others are procedural and not fundamentally different from most other common programming languages, and so don't have any READMEs associated with them.  Some (marked in **bold**) are more involved and have (or need) explanations.  Also, this year, I'm using .wls instead of .m, and trying to make the code somewhat readable as plaintext.

There's also a utilities file, Ulitities.nb, with some functions that proved useful in previous years.  This is not a true utils file, in that it isn't a paclet and that I don't import the function definitions directly, but it's mostly there as boilerplate code I can copy in when need be.

As there's a [creative craftsmanship challenge](https://old.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/w/gettincrafty) over on the Advent of Code subreddit this year, I'll be writing a poem for each problem each day and adding them here.

### Day 1: A Hero's Rest

Step softly, to the sandy shore  
And let another save the day.  
You've worked enough, five years or more,  
To earn a bit of play.  

Oh, you have learned to prod and poke  
At tortured puzzles from the Pole.  
You know what word the rover spoke.  
You fixed it when the printer broke.  
And now it's time to take a soak  
And lounge at this atoll.  

These five long years have left their mark,  
And R&R will hit the spot.  
Put down the Scala and the Spark,  
Put Lispy cars all into park,  
And watch a dolphin (or a shark),  
From deck chairs, on a yacht.  

No goals, this time, to work toward  
No consoles going 'beep'.  
No goblins swinging mace and sword,  
Just beaches, and a king's reward.  
(I'll gladly get the leaderboard  
While you can get some sleep!)  

### Day 2: Secure

Said the suit on the right to the suit on the left,  
"There's a problem we execs must fix.    
Our employees use passwords not strong or secure;  
We've tried warnings, but none of it sticks."  

Said the suit on the left to the suit on the right,  
"Then if warnings won't do, we need more.  
The incredible secrets of Tobaggan Inc.,  
Must not reach the sled rental next door."

Said the suit in the front to the suits on the side,  
"Let our action be swift and precise.  
We'll make rules and restrictions on passwords henceforth.   
And no letter shall enter one twice."   

Said the suit in the back to the suits up ahead,  
In a PowerPoint made on the spot,  
"We will limit the letters, point A and point B.  
One must have it, the other must not."

Then the suits all around all stood up and shook hands.  
Memoranda were typed and prepared.  
But the suit in the center, he stayed at his seat,  
To consider the meeting he'd chaired.  

Then the suit in the center, he slowly stood up,  
And focused his gaze on the rest.  
"This policy's *better* than ours was before,   
But it certainly is not the *best*."  

"A good policy's only the half of the thing,"  
Said the center suit.  "Still insecure!  
Why, if Sled Rental Inc. got a hold of this rule,  
They could get to our servers for sure!"  

All the suits in the room, save the center, recoiled  
At the thought of so dreadful a fate.  
All those snow coefficients, the tests and the codes,  
The schematics, served up on a plate.  

"So, the key to security," cautioned the suit,  
"Lies in randomly changing the rules.  
If the sled rental shop tries out *last* fortnight's codes,  
During *this* one, we'll play them like fools."

Said the suit on the left to the suit standing up    
(All the other suits scared as could be)  
"But then how, Senior Suit, can bimonthly rules work,  
When we meet just one month every three?"  

Then the suit in the center, he sighed with a smile.  
And said, "Then we'll make them right here.  
And we'll type up a memo and send it around  
With the passwords and rules for the year."  

In the evening, the suits filed out through the door.  
Corporate policy written anew.  
And the suit in the center sat down at his screen,  
And, for `password`, he typed `hunter2`.
