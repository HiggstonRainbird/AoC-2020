# Mathematica Advent of Code
# 2020

This repository stores my [Advent Of Code](http://adventofcode.com/2020/) solutions for 2020, written in Mathematica.  Some of these solutions are simple one-liners, and others are procedural and not fundamentally different from most other common programming languages, and so don't have any READMEs associated with them.  Some (marked in **bold**) are more involved and have (or need) explanations.

There's also a utilities file, Ulitities.nb, with some functions that proved useful in previous years.  This is not a true utils file, in that it isn't a paclet and that I don't import the function definitions directly, but it's mostly there as boilerplate code I can copy in when need be.

As there's also a [creative craftsmanship challenge](https://old.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/w/gettincrafty), I'll be writing a poem for each problem each day and adding them here.

### Day 1: A Hero's Rest

Step softly, to the sandy shore  
And let another save the day.  
You've worked enough, five years or more,  
To earn a bit of play.  

Oh, you have learned to prod and poke  
At tortured puzzles from the Pole.  
You know what word the rover spoke.  
You fixed it when the printer broke.  
And now it's time to take a soak  
And lounge at this atoll.  

These five long years have left their mark,  
And R&R will hit the spot.  
Put down the Scala and the Spark,  
Put Lispy cars all into park,  
And watch a dolphin (or a shark),  
From deck chairs, on a yacht.  

No goals, this time, to work toward  
No consoles going 'beep'.  
No goblins swinging mace and sword,  
Just beaches, and a king's reward.  
(I'll gladly get the leaderboard  
While you can get some sleep!)
